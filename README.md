# Bootstrap-Portfolio

The aim of this project was to recreate a personal porfolio using bootstrap components, such as navbars and jumbotrons. 

The main goal involved creating a page that represented my progress on the Front End Web Development bootcamp and showcased work I'd completed. This portfolio could then be used during potential interviews and assist in helping me land my first software role. 

Key features of the page include: 

- A navigation bar that links to important sections of the page.
- A jumbotron which contains relevant information about my previous experience.
- A work section containing bootstrap cards that provide information about previous work I've completed.
- A footer section containing relevant contact details, such as my LinkedIn and Github URLs. 

To assist in legibility of my code, I included commented headers. This ensures that any future refactoring - either by myself or others - will be simple and effective.
